===========================================================================

------------------------------------
        MAIN LINE COMMANDS
------------------------------------
        -Have to go on a line void of dialogue.
        -Used to process commands in between dialogue.
        -(Note, these must be put on a line void of dialogue / inline commands)
        -(This is enforced since swapping character mid-sentance is not possible)


Swap speaker    Use <setPlayerSpeaker:bool> to directly set the player/NPC as the speaker.
                        <setPlayerSpeaker:true>         sets player as the speaker.
                        <setPlayerSpeaker:false>        sets NPC as the speaker.
                        <swapSpeaker>                   swaps the current speaker.



------------------------------------
        IN-LINE COMMANDS
------------------------------------
        -Can be used in dialogue lines.
        -Used to alter the apearance of dialogue.
        -(Note, if used outside of dialouge lines, will be ignored if they rely on text)
        -(eg, <anim> is ignored but <event> is not)

                                <size=+18> to increase the point size by 18 points.
                                <size=-14> to decrease the point size by 14 points.
                                </size> to end the size tag.

                                <#FF8000> or any other hexadecimal code to define a color.
                                </color> to end the color tag.

    >Custom Text Tags<

Animation               Use <anim:string animName> and </anim>.
                        The text between these tags is animated based on the animName
                                "wave"  :Text moves in a sin wave pattern
                                "shake" :Text shakes/jitters
Pause                   Use <pause:float pauseSeconds>. waits here for pauseSeconds seconds.
                        (can also use <p>)
                                Alternatively, use one of these values in place of int pauseSeconds:
                                "tiny"  :0.1f
                                "short" :0.25f
                                "normal":0.666f
                                "long"  :1f
                                "read"  :2f
Speed Change            Use <speed:int newSpeed>. Changes the time between each character being displayed.
                        (can also use <sp>)
                                Alternatively, use one of these values in place of int newSpeed:
                                "rapid" :0.01f
                                "fast"  :0.03f
                                "normal":0.07f
                                "slow"  :0.1f
                                "snail" :0.15f
Sound effect            Use <sound:int soundID>. Plays the sound clip with that ID (index).
                        (can also use <sfx>)
                                Sound clips are stored in the dialogue brain and are the same for all actors.
                                ID is the same as the Index of that sound in the sound clip list.   
Event                   Use <event:int eventID>. Invokes the event with that ID.
                        (can also use <e>)
                                Events are stored on the "Dialogue Events" script on the actor (required component), and are unique to each actor.
