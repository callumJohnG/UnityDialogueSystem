                        Custom Dialogue System
                        by Callum Gillespie
===========================================================================
Created in Unity 2021.3.13f
=========[REQUIRED/SUGGESTED PACKAGES]==========
New Input System
URP



=========[How to set up]==========
>Place the dialogue brain prefab in the scene (from the prefabs folder) (make sure there is only one brain in the scene).
>Assign the required text components to the dialogue brain in the inspector.
>Assign the player's (main character's) name, image, voice, and colour here (name and image are optional)
>Create a button input to call "NextDialogue()" on the brain in order for the text to progress properly.
        Button input should be the same as the input used to initiate dialogue.
        This is because as the player starts a dialogue (with the button) it should then immediately call NextDialogue().
        This will be improved on and fixed an a future update.

>Place the "dialogue actor" script onto any object you wish to be an actor.
>Assign that characters name, image, voice and colour in the inspector (name and image are optional)
>Create dialogue text assets for the character and assign them in the editor
        See the Documentation for tag explanations
        For examples on how to use the tags, see the example text assets in the "sample scene/assets/text assets" folder.
>Create unity events inside the "Dialouge Events" class
        This class is required by Dialogue Actor, so will always appear on the same object as the DialogueActor script
        Unity cannot show a list of Events in the inspector, which is why this seperate class with a custom editor is needed
        Create the events in this class with unique ID's, and they will be invoked when an <event> command is called by this actor during dialogue
        NOTE : If two events have the same ID, the first will be called. If none have the ID, none are called.

=========[How to use]==========
>To start a dialogue, call the "StartDialogue()" method on the actor.
        The dialogue will start using the next text asset in the dialouge actors list of dialogues.
        If all the dialouges have been used, the last one in the list will be repeated by default.
                If the actors "repeatLastDialogue" is unchecked, then when dialouge runs out they will no longer be interactable (untill more dialouge is added)
>To progress the dialogue, call the "NextDialogue()" method on the brain.
        This is NOT automatically called when "StartDialogue()" is called, so a brain input system is needed.
        "NextDialogue()" only proceeds when a dialogue in on-going.
